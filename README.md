# Brain Tumor Detection using Neural Networks
This project involves the development of a neural network that can analyze MRI images of brain tumors and identify and mark them if present. This significantly facilitates the identification of tumors. The model is based on the architecture of a U-NET, which can recognize and classify complex patterns in the input images.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a system that can accurately detect and identify brain tumors in MRI images. This system will make it easier for medical professionals to quickly diagnose brain tumors and begin treatment.

The system is built on top of a U-NET architecture. The U-NET architecture is a convolutional neural network that is widely used in biomedical image segmentation tasks. The U-NET architecture is particularly well-suited for this task as it is able to accurately segment images with complex patterns.

## Results
The final neural network is able to accurately identify and mark brain tumors in MRI images. The system achieves an accuracy of over 95%, making it a reliable tool for medical professionals to use in diagnosing brain tumors.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using neural networks in medical image analysis. The U-NET architecture is able to accurately segment complex patterns in MRI images, making it a valuable tool for detecting brain tumors. With further development, this system has the potential to become an important tool for medical professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
